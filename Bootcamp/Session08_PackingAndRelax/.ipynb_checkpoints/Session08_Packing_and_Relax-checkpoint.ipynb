    "So that was fun, but it was expensive. Usually when trying to get some task completed with Rosetta, we need to run a protocol repeatedly. If one protocol takes 10 mintues and another protocol takes 20 minutes, then we can run the 10-minute protocol twice as many times. If they both give equivalent results, then the 10-minute protocol is more likely to give us a useful design. So how can we optimize this protocol?\n",

First what will happen is the fast relax mover will construct a MoveMap and set some things in that MoveMap. Then it will give that MoveMap to the MoveMapFactory we're going to create. The MoveMapFactory then has the chance to modify the MoveMap. When the fast relax mover initializes the MoveMap, it sets both backbone and chi dihedrals set to change. First our MoveMapFactory will need to turn them off. Then we'll turn back *on* backbone and chi dihedrals for the CDR residues. Let's also let the sidechains minimize of the neighboring residues."

If you invoke it 10 times, you will get 10 different answers. The larger the structure you're modeling, the more noise you will introduce. Is one H1 conformation better than another because of the contacts it forms at the interface, or is its lower energy due to FastRelax relieving strain on the other side of the molecule that it couldn't in the other invocations? The more DOFs you open up, the more sampling you have to do to overcome the noise."
